Note: BunnyPeople.org does not read any of your private online communications.</p>
        <p>BunnyPeople.org encourages you to review the privacy statements of Web sites you choose to link to from BunnyPeople.org so that you can understand how those Web sites collect, use and share your information. BunnyPeople.org is not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on Web sites outside of the BunnyPeople.org and BunnyPeople.org family of Web sites.</p>

        <p>Use of your Personal Information</p>

        <p>BunnyPeople.org collects and uses your personal information to operate the BunnyPeople.org Web site and deliver the services you have requested. BunnyPeople.org also uses your personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or services available from BunnyPeople.org and its affiliates. BunnyPeople.org may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered.</p>

        <p>Use of Cookies</p>

        <p>The BunnyPeople.org Web site use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.</p>
        <p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize BunnyPeople.org pages, or register with BunnyPeople.org site or services, a cookie helps BunnyPeople.org to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same BunnyPeople.org Web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the BunnyPeople.org features that you customized.</p>
        <p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the BunnyPeople.org services or Web sites you visit.</p>

        <p>Security of your Personal Information</p>

        <p>BunnyPeople.org secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. BunnyPeople.org secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other Web sites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.</p>

        <p>Changes to this Statement</p>

        <p>BunnyPeople.org will occasionally update this Statement of Privacy to reflect company and customer feedback. BunnyPeople.org encourages you to periodically review this Statement to be informed of how BunnyPeople.org is protecting your information.</p>
