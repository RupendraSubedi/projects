				<p>Most of the diseases and sicknesses we face today are caused from the foods we are eating right now. There are likely tons of others, but that is a must avoid! It doesnâ€™t have to be expencive. Its about eating the simple foods, fruits, and veggies.The grocery department offers you variety of produces like Spinach, Tomatoes, Potatoes, Watercress, Dill, Cilantro and many more. They are all guaranteed fresh and organic. </p>
				<p>We also do some traditional food cultivation and preparation for certain foods that are little too much to prepare in the household. Note that the preparation does not include cooking any kind of food inside or by the store. </p>

				<h2 class="text-center"> <a href="pages/olist.htm" style="color: rgb(173, 24, 24);">Meat</a></h2>
				<p>Organic meat certification in the United States requires farm animals to be raised according to USDA organic regulations throughout their lives. These regulations require that livestock are fed certified organic food that contains no animal byproducts. Further, organic farm animals can receive no growth hormones or antibiotics, and they must be raised using techniques that protect native species and other natural resources.We offer fresh and home chopped unprocessed meat for you. We got raw-fresh Pork, raw-fresh Chicken and Roasted-Chicken, Beef, Goat meat and fresh Fish.The price however might differ from other regular store but we go as low and cheap as we can for the customer.</p>

				<p>All the dairy products that we sell are 100% guaranteed fresh.Cows that produce certified organic milk which we have in our store are not given antibiotics or added growth hormones. In addition to having access to the outdoors, cows on certified organic farms are fed 100% organic feed, so consequently they're not exposed to persistent pesticides, herbicides or fungicides, eliminating the possibility that these chemicals may turn up as residues in the milk.</p>
				<p> We offer you fresh raw and skimmed milk, raw salted and unsalted butter, home-made cheese, eggs, and other dairy products such as yogurt, IceCream, sour-milk and many more.</p>
